# KP Theme: movie selection app.
This my course project written on c# WPF. Such patterns as Repository , Unit of Work and MVVM used here.
Entity Framework with Code First approach is used to connect to the database.
If you will take my app than rewrite the note, because i was f*cked because of it.
Don't forget to change connection string.
Good luck with your coursework =)
